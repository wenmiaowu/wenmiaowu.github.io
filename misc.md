# Miscellaneous

This is a space for everything that doesn’t fit neatly into my Projects or Writing — including reflections, inspirations, side quests, and maybe some lighter content as well. ✨

## Blog
- Random projects
- What I've learnt from doing workouts (badminton, running etc)
- A personal reflection on transitioning careers
- [How do I understand DEI](inspirations/DEI.md)

## Inspirations
>To me, adulthood is all about knowing who I am — a journey that takes time, practice, and wisdom.

- A quote or idea that moved me.
 
## I am a K-pop lover!
I especially enjoy traveling solo to different places to watch concerts -- though I'm not much of a photographer ;)

# Miscellaneous

This is a space for everything that doesn’t fit neatly into my Projects or Writing — including reflections, inspirations, side quests, and maybe some lighter content as well. ✨

## Blog for fun
- Random projects
- Book reviews
- Personal reflections
- What I've learnt from doing workouts (badminton, running etc)

## Inspirations
- A quote or idea that moved me
- A personal reflection on transitioning careers
- [How do I understand DEI](inspirations/DEI.md)
 
## I am a K-pop lover!
I especially enjoy traveling solo to different countries to watch concerts -- though I'm not much of a photographer ;)

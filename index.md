Iâ€™m a researcher transitioning into data, ESG, and quantitative analysis. I'm skilled in R and Stata, and currently learning SQL and Python.

## About Me

I hold two master's degrees and have spent the last several years engaged in research, teaching, and public-facing projects related to inequality, political values, and educational accessibility. My current focus is transitioning into data/ESG/market research roles, combining my social science foundation with growing technical skills in Python, SQL, and data visualization. Iâ€™m particularly interested in how people express attitudes under authoritarian settings, and how data can reveal hidden preferences and behavior.

## What I've Learnt from Running

Running - or doing any kind of workout, like weight training or playing badminton - helps me understand myself better. It allows me to notice my limits: the speed I feel comfortable at, the speed that challenges me, and the ones that I can't maintain yet. It also trains my concentration. When I run, I can't think about things that have haunted my mind for years - unimportant things I've spent far too much time on. I just focus on my breathing, on whether my heels hit the ground first. 

It also is about self-care, and maybe even self-love. I started working out because I want to stay healthy. But I used to be a bit pushy, pushing myself to run harder, staying longer on the treadmill. I am not sure if this is a good mindset to be honest. 

Maybe small wins matter too. Maybe they matter more than we think.
